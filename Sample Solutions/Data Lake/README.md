# Data Lake Solutions
This repository contains example workflows to build data lake solutions on Top of Microsoft Viva and Microsoft Graph data sources.
For ease of use and better understanding, each of these data sources are ingested and processed in separate solutions/pipelines. However, one can create a combination pipeline
leveraging any of these data scources.

The solutions are created within Azure Synapse Analytics Studio that combines data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics in one platform.
However, they can be re-created using Azure Data Factory and a big data analytics of your choice like Databricks.
